# Sokoban Solver Improvements

## Problem Statement
The original solver could only solve Easy levels 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. It failed on Easy-4 and all Medium/Hard levels.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Inefficient Successor Generation
The `generateSuccessorsWithMoves()` method in `SolverAStar.cpp` was generating **individual player moves** (U/D/L/R) instead of only generating states where boxes were pushed. This caused an exponential explosion in the search space:
- For a typical Sokoban level, the player can move to many positions without pushing any boxes
- Each such move created a new state in the search
- This led to 75,000+ nodes being explored without finding a solution for Easy-4

### Issue 2: Disabled Deadlock Detection
Deadlock detection was commented out in lines 179-189 of `SolverAStar.cpp`, likely during debugging. Without deadlock detection:
- The solver explored many dead-end states
- States where boxes were pushed into unwinnable positions were not pruned
- This wasted significant computational resources

### Issue 3: Overly Aggressive Deadlock Detection
The wall and multibox deadlock detection had false positives:
- Easy-6 was incorrectly flagged as deadlocked in the initial state
- Wall deadlock detection was too strict, checking for goals along wall lines rather than overall reachability
- Multibox deadlock detection incorrectly flagged valid initial configurations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Successor Generation
**File**: `src/SolverAStar.cpp` (line 288-310)

**Before**: Generated individual player moves (U/D/L/R) creating massive search space

**After**: Uses the proper `generateSuccessors()` function from `SuccessorGenerator.cpp` which:
- Uses `PlayerPathfinder` to find reachable positions efficiently
- Only generates successors for **box pushes**, not individual player moves
- Significantly reduces the branching factor of the search

### 2. Re-enabled Deadlock Detection
**File**: `src/SolverAStar.cpp` (line 173-180)

**Before**: 
```cpp
// TEMPORARILY DISABLE deadlock detection to test
// if (heuristics.isDeadlocked(successorNode->state))
// {
//   delete successorNode;
//   continue;
// }
```

**After**:
```cpp
// Enable deadlock detection to prune dead-end states
if (heuristics.isDeadlocked(successorNode->state))
{
  // Deadlocked state - skip it
  delete successorNode;
  continue;
}
```

### 3. Improved Wall Deadlock Detection
**File**: `src/SokobanHeuristics.cpp` (line 321-358)

**Change**: Modified to only flag a box as wall-deadlocked if it has **infinite distance to all goals** (i.e., truly unreachable), rather than checking if there are goals along specific wall lines.

This eliminates false positives while still catching truly deadlocked states.

### 4. Disabled Multibox Deadlock Detection
**File**: `src/SokobanHeuristics.cpp` (line 711-721)

**Change**: Temporarily disabled multibox deadlock detection as it had too many false positives. The detection logic needs to be improved to handle complex box configurations correctly.

### 5. Increased Search Limits
**File**: `src/SolverAStar.cpp` (line 159-170)

- Increased node expansion limit from 500,000 to 1,000,000
- Changed progress reporting interval from every 25,000 to every 50,000 nodes
- Allows solver to explore more states for complex puzzles

## Results

### Easy Puzzles (All Now Solve)
| Level   | Status  | Time      | Nodes Expanded | Solution Length |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Easy-1  | ✓ Solved | 0 ms     | 1              | 1 moves         |
| Easy-2  | ✓ Solved | 0 ms     | 2              | 3 moves         |
| Easy-3  | ✓ Solved | 15 ms    | 284            | 3 moves         |
| Easy-4  | ✓ Solved | 31.2 s   | 41,657         | 12 moves        |
| Easy-5  | ✓ Solved | 39 ms    | 676            | 4 moves         |
| Easy-6  | ✓ Solved | 49 ms    | 933            | 8 moves         |

### Performance Improvement for Easy-4
- **Before**: Failed to solve (hit 500K node limit, still no solution)
- **After**: Solves in 31 seconds with 41,657 nodes explored

This represents a **>10x improvement** in search efficiency due to proper successor generation.

## Known Limitations

### Medium and Hard Puzzles
These puzzles require **key collection** functionality, which is not currently implemented:
- Players need to walk over keys (lowercase letters) to pick them up
- Keys are then used to unlock corresponding boxes (uppercase letters)
- The current `SuccessorGenerator.cpp` only handles pushing boxes with keys already held
- It doesn't generate successors for key pickup actions

### Future Work
To solve Medium and Hard puzzles:
1. Implement key collection in the successor generator
2. Add state tracking for which keys have been picked up vs. which are still on the board
3. Update the state hash to include available keys
4. Ensure deadlock detection accounts for key availability

## Testing
All Easy puzzles (1-6) have been verified to solve correctly with the improvements. The solver maintains correctness while significantly improving performance.
